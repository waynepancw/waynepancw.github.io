## Bio
I am a Ph.D. student in Systems Engineering at ASU with a mechanical engineering background. My interests are in robotics control, wearable devices, and using sensory feedback to improve interactions between robots and human operators. Currently, I work on feedback control of wearable robots using physiological signals.
